In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife inside the river. 
One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the berry tree.
The kind-hearted monkey, offered him some berries. 
The crocodile came back the next day for more berries as he loved them.
As days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
